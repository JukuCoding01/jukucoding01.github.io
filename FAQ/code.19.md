### Buttons on MUSIC Block Don't Work?

- The buttons won't work if the MUSIC block is connected to the Queen block.

- Check connection. The middle button should be lit to indicate that it is working. Make sure that the block is connected to a power source through the USB cord. The AUX cord should be plugged into a speaker that is running on AUX mode.
