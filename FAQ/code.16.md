### Playing Unexpected Audio

- Make sure that the fruits connected to different clamps are not touching. If fruits are touching or too close with one another, touching one fruit may be equivalent to touching two or several, resutling in unexpected audio playing. Try seperate the fruits or move them further away with each other.

- If the above doesn't work, double check the connections between different blocks and scrutinize your program to see if there are any small mistakes that might escaped your eyes.
