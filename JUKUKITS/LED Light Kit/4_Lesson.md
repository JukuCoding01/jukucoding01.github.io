## Lesson 2

### Step 1: Random Red 1

Drag “set item to 0” block to the top and rename “item” to “r”.

### Step 2: Random Red 2

Drag “random number integer” block to the right of the previous block, replacing the “0” block.

![](./image/l2s2.jpg)

### Step 3: Random Red 3

Replace the number for R in the “set LIGHT BAR color” block with “item” block, and change “item” to “r”.

![](./image/l2s3.jpg)

### Step 4: Random Green 1

Repeat this for green. Drag “set item to 0” block to the top and rename “item” to “g”. Use a random integer to replace number “0”.

### Step 5: Random Green 2

Replace the number for G in the “set LIGHT BAR color” block with “item” block, and change “item” to “g”.

### Step 6: Random Blue

Try to repeat the same process we did to red and green to the color blue.

### Step 7: Iterate 1

Drag “count with i with” block out and place it on the very top.

![](./image/l2s7.jpg)

### Step 8: Iterate 2

Change the number of the “count” block to “from 0 to 29”

![](./image/l2s8.jpg)

### Step 9: Iterate 3

Drag everything below the “count” block inside the block.

![](./image/l2s9.jpg)

### Step 10: Iterate 4

Change the number in the “set LIGHT BAR color” to variable “i”

![](./image/l2s10.jpg)

### Step 11: Lighting up the entire light strip

Drag the “set LIGHT BAR clean” block out of the “count” block and put it at the end of the program.

### Step 12: Dim 1

Drag “count with i with” block out and place it under the first “count” block.

![](./image/l2s12.jpg)

### Step 13: Dim 2

Change the number of the “count” block to “from 29 to 0 by -1”.

![](./image/l2s13.jpg)

### Step 14: Dim 3

Drag a “set LIGHT BAR color” block and put it in the second “count” block.

![](./image/l2s14.jpg)

### Step 15: Dim 4

Set the color of to black (i.e. no light), and change the position parameter to “i”
